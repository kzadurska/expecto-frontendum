# Expecto frontendum blog

or what happens when two Potter geeks decide to start a blog about frontend

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repo**

1.  **Install dependencies**

    Make sure you have `node` and `npm` installed first.
    Navigate into the cloned directory and install dependencies through npm:

    ```sh
    cd expecto-frontendum
    npm ci
    ```

1.  **Start developing**

    Start the blog locally:

    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing**

    The blog is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool we use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

## Contribution

Create a feature branch and open a new pull request to the base branch. Avoid commiting straight to master.


## Deployment

Deploy the blog to github pages:

```sh
npm run deploy
```

_Note: Default deploy commit is "Updates". To be changed_

### Continuous integration

### What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── .cache
    ├── content
    ├── node_modules
    ├── public
    ├── src
    ├── static
    ├── .eslintrc.js
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── gatsby-node.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md

1. **`/.cache`**: Filse generated by Gatsby and used by it internally (visible only after running `gatsby develop` or `gatsby build`).

1. **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that the project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

1. **`/public`**: Output folder for static files generated Gatsby (visible only after running `gatsby develop` or `gatsby build`). This is what gets deployed online.

1. **`/content`**: Contains blog posts and other content-related files (like authors list).

1. **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of the site (what you see in the browser) such as site's header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

1. **`/static`**: Contains files not processed during build step (they're copied directly to the output folder).

1. **`.eslintc.js`**: This is a [ESLint](https://eslint.org//) configuration file. It helps us keep the code linted.

1. **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track/maintain a version history for.

1. **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of the code consistent.

1. **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

1. **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where we specify information about the site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

1. **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

1. **`LICENSE`**: Gatsby is licensed under the MIT license, and so is this project.

1. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of npm dependencies that were installed for this project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

1. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for this project.

1. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about the project.

### Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers it is recommended to start with an [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to GatsbyJS documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.
